\section{Course Description}%{{{

From news to cutting-edge scientific papers, from a home office to the largest companies in the world, data visualization is a critical method for revealing patterns in data and telling stories. 
Because data visualization is indispensable in understanding data, and because more and more decisions are driven by data, data visualization has become an essential skill for every knowledge worker.  
This course is an introduction to basic statistical data analysis and visualization.  
We will learn fundamentals of data visualization in the context of perception, integrity, design, statistics, types of data, and visualization techniques.  
The hands-on exercises using the Python stack aim to equip you with practical data visualization skills and they will be an integral part of the course. 

\paragraph{Relationships with E583/Z637 Information Visualization (IVMOOC):}
Compared with E583/Z637, this course is geared more towards producing fundamental statistical visualizations and exploratory data analysis using the Python data science and visualization stack.  
Therefore, this course may be more suitable for students who pursue their careers in research, development, engineering, and data analysis, and those who will directly process and analyze complex datasets. 

%}}}
\section{Course Objectives}%{{{

By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to understand, explain, and manipulate basic types of data, analyze them by applying basic exploratory visualization techniques, and create explanatory visualizations. 
You are also expected to be able to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of data visualizations based on the principles of human perception, design, types of data, and visualization techniques. 
 

%}}}
\section{Communication} %{{{

Announcements and all communication will be through Slack: 

\url{https://iu-dviz-course.slack.com}

The first thing you need to do when you enroll this course is to join the course slack. You can create an account by using one of the following IU email addresses: \texttt{indiana.edu}, \texttt{umail.iu.edu}, \texttt{iu.edu}, and \texttt{iupui.edu}. Visit \url{https://join.slack.com/t/iu-dviz-course/signup} to signup.

Slack allows both private (group) communications and public fora. The number-one recommendation from the previous students for the new students was to learn to use Slack and get used to it as soon as possible. Email and Canvas will not be very effective due to the large email volume that the instructor receives usually. Please expect the following response time:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Email or Canvas}: the instructor will respond within \emph{one week} (likely within several days).
\item \textbf{Slack}: the instructor will respond within \emph{one day} (likely within several hours).

\end{itemize}

%}}}
\section{Prerequisites}%{{{
\label{sec:Prerequisites}

%This course's residential version is open to advanced undergraduate students as well as graduate students; online version of this course is open to graduate students.

%\paragraph{(Residential course)} You are expected to attend every class and engage in class discussions. 
%You are not allowed to use your phone or computer during the class unless explicitly asked to do so.  
%You are expected to read assigned reading materials prior to the class meetings if there is any.
%At the beginning of most class meetings, there will be an \emph{in-class quiz} based on the assigned readings and materials from the previous classes. 
%You are expected to complete all weekly assignments. 

%\paragraph{(Online)} You are expected to complete all course modules and assignments. 
%You are also expected to engage in discussions on Canvas and Slack. 

%}}}
\section{Grading}\label{sec:grading_tentative_}%{{{

The grade may be shifted at the end of the course because of new assignments, changes in the course from the previous offerings, etc. Therefore, the grade that you can see on Canvas may not be the grade you receive finally. 

There will be small extra credits for active engagement on Slack, in terms of sharing useful resources \& interesting visualization related articles, participating in discussions, and helping other students (e.g.~answering questions)

\section{Policies}%{{{
\begin{enumerate}%{{{

\item \emph{Disabilities.} Every attempt will be made to accommodate qualified
students with disabilities (e.g. mental health, learning, chronic health,
physical, hearing, vision, neurological, etc.). You must have established your
eligibility for support services through Disability Services for Students. Note
that services are confidential, may take time to put into place, and are not
retroactive.  Captions and alternate media for print materials may take three
or more weeks to get produced. Please contact Disability Services for Students
at \url{http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu} or 812-855-7578 as soon as
possible if accommodations are needed. The office is located on the third
floor, west tower, of the Wells Library (Room W302). Walk-ins are welcome 8 AM
to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. You can also locate a variety of campus
resources for students and visitors who need assistance at
\url{http://www.iu.edu/~ada/index.shtml}. 

\item \emph{Sexual misconduct and Title IX.} As your instructor, one of my
responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students.
Title IX and IU's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any
form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and
domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone
who has, the University can help. If you are seeking help and would like to
speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

\begin{enumerate}
    
\item The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
\item Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
\item IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

\end{enumerate}

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU's Title IX Coordinator. 
In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available. 
Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist. 
I encourage you to visit \emph{stopsexualviolence.iu.edu} to learn more. 

%\item \emph{No electronics---laptops, tablets, and smartphones---may be used in class}, unless the usage is specifically requested by the instructors (e.g.~Top Hat).  
%It has been shown that \href{http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/}{using laptops in class hurts learning, \emph{even if} you are using it to take notes}.  
%If you must have electronics due to a special reason, please obtain permission beforehand. 

\item \emph{Be honest.} Your assignments and papers should be your own work.  
If you find useful resources for your assignments, share them and cite them. 
If your friends helped you, acknolwedge them. 
You should feel free to discuss both online and offline, but do not show your code directly.  
Any cases of academic misconduct (cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, etc) will be reported to the School and the Dean of Students, following the standard procedure. 
\emph{Cheating is not cool}. 

\item \emph{You have the responsibility of backing up all your data and code}.
Always back up your code and data. You should at least use Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive at the minimum.
Ideally, learn version control systems and use \url{https://github.iu.edu} or \url{https://github.com}. 
Loss of data, code, or papers due to various reasons (e.g. malfunction of your laptop) is not an acceptable excuse for delayed or missing submission. 

%\item \emph{Inform your excused absences prior to class}. Please contact the instructor until the previous day for an excused absence.  

%\item \emph{Late assignments}. There will be 10\% late penalty for the late assignments unless excused. 

%\item If you have any mental issues, don't hesistate to contact me or \href{http://healthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/index.shtml}{IU's Counseling and Psychological Services}, which provides free counseling sessions.
