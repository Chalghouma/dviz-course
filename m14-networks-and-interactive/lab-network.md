# Gephi

Gephi is probably the most popular network visualization tool nowadays; it also supports the calculation of basic network statistics. You can download and install Gephi from [here](https://gephi.org/).

Gephi supports CSV, spreadsheet, [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language) and other formats. Some network datasets are available [here](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets). Download one of your choice; if you don't know which one to use, the Zachary's karate club is a classic network dataset, you can read its story [here](https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/zacharykarateclub). 

The official tutorial of Gephi is available [here](https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf), it shows many of Gephi's most useful features. ** Go through the tutorial but substitute the Les Miserables network with the network you downloaded (feel free to try other layouts/compute other metrics, etc). Make a screenshot of your final network visualization and submit it to Canvas.**

Note that the tutorial uses an older version of Gephi, so some details may be different, but the main points should be the same.
