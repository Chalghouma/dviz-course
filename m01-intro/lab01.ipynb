        "First download Anaconda for your system (Python 3) from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download). The `miniconda` is a minimal version on which you need to install necessary packages. If you don't have much space or prefer to install only necessary packages, `miniconda` will suit you. Anaconda comes with a package manager called `conda`. \n",

        "In Jupyter notebook/lab, you can choose the python kernel. Say if you have both python3.5 and python3.7, Jupyter lets you use the version of your choice. Furthermore, by choosing a kernel, you also use the packages installed with that kernel. So if you use `dviz` virtual environment that you set up with Anaconda, you can also use the python kernel and the packages installed in this virtual environment in Jupyter. \n",
